			"description": "In the rapidly evolving cloud landscape, serverless has become a transformative force, offering scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced operational overhead. However, the reality of selecting, customizing, and maintaining serverless patterns presents significant challenges, especially as applications grow in complexity and scale. This talk will introduce the innovative strategy of productized patterns, which standardizes common use cases into highly configurable, reusable, and adaptable components that address cross-service complexities like IAM permissions, state management, and failover mechanisms. We will explore how adopting productized patterns can streamline serverless workloads, making them more manageable, scalable, and efficient, and empower organizations to fully leverage the full power of the cloud.",

They can be used for synchronous tasks, such as handling API calls, or for asynchronous tasks, like consuming SQS queues or DynamoDB streams. Lambda functions are designed to get the job done. However, as a developer, using Lambda functions comes with its challenges. Cloud environments are prone to failures, and when dealing with a large number of lambda functions, there is often repetitive code that is not directly related to the business logic and is highly specific to AWS. AWS Powertools is a library that helps address these challenges in your Lambda functions. It enhances your functions in areas such as observability, resiliency, and operational excellence.",

Such an infrastructure could meet the needs of an application to help visually impaired people in their daily lives.
